# Output Examples

This document provides examples of the CSV outputs generated by the similarity analysis script.

## embeddings.csv

This file contains the document embeddings with metadata. Each row represents one document.

**Format:**
```csv
filename,topic,subtopic,dim_0,dim_1,dim_2,...,dim_383
llm_01.md,LLM,Model Architecture,0.123456,-0.234567,0.345678,...,0.456789
math_01.md,Math,Linear Algebra,0.234567,-0.345678,0.456789,...,0.567890
fruit_01.md,Fruit,Citrus,0.345678,-0.456789,0.567890,...,0.678901
...
```

**Columns:**
- `filename`: The name of the document file
- `topic`: The main topic category (LLM, Math, or Fruit)
- `subtopic`: The specific subtopic within the category
- `dim_0` through `dim_N`: The embedding vector dimensions (typically 384 dimensions for the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)

**Usage:**
This file can be loaded into Jupyter notebooks or Pandas DataFrames for further analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load embeddings
df = pd.read_csv('embeddings.csv')

# Get embedding vectors (all columns after 'subtopic')
embedding_columns = [col for col in df.columns if col.startswith('dim_')]
embeddings = df[embedding_columns].values

# Get metadata
metadata = df[['filename', 'topic', 'subtopic']]

# Example: Find documents by topic
llm_docs = df[df['topic'] == 'LLM']
```

## similarity_results.csv

This file contains pairwise similarity scores between all documents. The results are sorted by similarity score (highest to lowest).

**Format:**
```csv
document1_filename,document1_topic,document1_subtopic,document2_filename,document2_topic,document2_subtopic,similarity_score,same_topic
llm_01.md,LLM,Model Architecture,llm_02.md,LLM,Prompt Design,0.856234,true
math_01.md,Math,Linear Algebra,math_02.md,Math,Calculus,0.823456,true
llm_03.md,LLM,Text Processing,llm_04.md,LLM,RAG Systems,0.798765,true
fruit_01.md,Fruit,Citrus,fruit_02.md,Fruit,Berries,0.734521,true
llm_01.md,LLM,Model Architecture,math_01.md,Math,Linear Algebra,0.456789,false
...
```

**Columns:**
- `document1_filename`: Name of the first document in the pair
- `document1_topic`: Topic of the first document
- `document1_subtopic`: Subtopic of the first document
- `document2_filename`: Name of the second document in the pair
- `document2_topic`: Topic of the second document
- `document2_subtopic`: Subtopic of the second document
- `similarity_score`: Cosine similarity score (0 to 1, where 1 is most similar)
- `same_topic`: Boolean indicating if both documents share the same topic

**Usage:**
This file can be used for various analyses:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load similarity results
similarities = pd.read_csv('similarity_results.csv')

# Find most similar cross-topic pairs
cross_topic = similarities[similarities['same_topic'] == 'false']
most_similar_cross = cross_topic.head(10)

# Calculate average similarity within topics
within_topic = similarities[similarities['same_topic'] == 'true']
avg_by_topic = within_topic.groupby('document1_topic')['similarity_score'].mean()

# Find similar documents for a specific file
doc_similarities = similarities[
    (similarities['document1_filename'] == 'llm_01.md') |
    (similarities['document2_filename'] == 'llm_01.md')
]
```

## Console Output

The script continues to display the same printf-style console output as before, showing:
- Progress messages during processing
- Documents grouped by topic
- Top 20 most similar document pairs
- Average similarity within topics
- Average similarity across topics
- Export confirmation messages

This console output is preserved for real-time monitoring and quick analysis, while the CSV files provide structured data for deeper investigation.
