# Fine-Tuning Technique 11

**Topic:** LLM
**Sub-Topic:** Fine-Tuning Techniques
**Sub-Sub-Topic:** Prompt Engineering

This document discusses the fine-tuning technique known as Prompt Engineering, which is a crucial aspect of optimizing large language models (LLMs). Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model to improve its performance on specific tasks or datasets. Prompt Engineering designs effective input prompts to guide model outputs.

### Key Points
- **Definition:** Crafts input text to elicit desired model responses.
- **Use Cases:** Zero-shot learning, controlling output style.
- **Advantages:** No model weights need to be updated.
- **Challenges:** Requires creativity and iteration.
- **Best Practices:** Use few-shot examples and clear instructions.

### Example
A prompt with step-by-step reasoning examples improves a model's accuracy on math word problems from 60% to 85%.

### Conclusion
Prompt Engineering is a powerful method for fine-tuning LLMs, unlocking capabilities without retraining. By understanding and applying this technique, practitioners can maximize model utility with minimal effort.
