# Fine-Tuning Technique 07

**Topic:** LLM
**Sub-Topic:** Fine-Tuning Techniques
**Sub-Sub-Topic:** Model Evaluation

This document discusses the fine-tuning technique known as Model Evaluation, which is a crucial aspect of optimizing large language models (LLMs). Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model to improve its performance on specific tasks or datasets. Model Evaluation assesses performance using appropriate metrics.

### Key Points
- **Definition:** Measures model performance on held-out data.
- **Use Cases:** Comparing models, detecting overfitting.
- **Advantages:** Ensures reliability and generalizability.
- **Challenges:** Choosing the right metrics for the task.
- **Best Practices:** Use multiple metrics and cross-validation.

### Example
A chatbot's fine-tuned model is evaluated using both perplexity and human judgment, revealing strengths in coherence but weaknesses in factual accuracy.

### Conclusion
Model Evaluation is a powerful method for fine-tuning LLMs, providing actionable insights for improvement. By understanding and applying this technique, practitioners can iteratively enhance model quality.
