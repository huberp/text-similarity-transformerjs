# Graph Theory Fundamentals

**Topic:** Math
**Sub-Topic:** Graph Theory

This document explores graph theory, the mathematical study of networks and relationships. Graphs model connections between entities, making them invaluable for analyzing social networks, transportation systems, computer networks, and molecular structures.

### Core Definitions
- **Graphs:** Collections of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (links).
- **Directed vs. Undirected:** Whether edges have directionality.
- **Weighted Graphs:** Edges have associated numerical values.
- **Paths:** Sequences of vertices connected by edges.
- **Cycles:** Paths that start and end at the same vertex.

### Important Properties
Graph connectivity determines if paths exist between all vertex pairs. Degree measures the number of edges connected to a vertex. Trees are connected acyclic graphs, fundamental to computer science.

### Classic Problems
The Seven Bridges of Königsberg inspired Euler's work. Shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's find optimal routes. Graph coloring determines minimum colors needed so adjacent vertices differ.

### Applications
Social network analysis uses graph metrics to identify influential nodes. Internet routing relies on shortest path algorithms. Chemical informatics represents molecules as graphs to predict properties.

### Conclusion
Graph theory provides powerful abstractions for modeling relationships and networks, with applications spanning computer science, operations research, and natural sciences.
