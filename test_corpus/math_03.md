# Probability Theory

**Topic:** Math
**Sub-Topic:** Probability

This document examines probability theory, the mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty and randomness. Probability is essential for statistics, machine learning, risk assessment, and decision-making under uncertainty.

### Basic Concepts
- **Sample Space:** The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
- **Events:** Subsets of the sample space that we assign probabilities to.
- **Probability Axioms:** Non-negativity, normalization, and additivity.
- **Conditional Probability:** Probability of an event given that another event has occurred.
- **Independence:** Events whose occurrence doesn't affect each other's probability.

### Probability Distributions
Discrete distributions like binomial and Poisson model countable outcomes. Continuous distributions like normal and exponential describe real-valued random variables. Understanding these distributions is crucial for statistical modeling.

### Bayes' Theorem
This fundamental result relates conditional probabilities and enables probabilistic inference. Bayesian methods update beliefs based on evidence, forming the foundation of modern machine learning techniques.

### Applications
Probability theory underpins statistical inference, risk analysis, game theory, and machine learning algorithms including naive Bayes classifiers and probabilistic graphical models.

### Conclusion
Probability theory provides rigorous tools for reasoning about uncertainty, making it fundamental to data science, artificial intelligence, and quantitative decision-making.
