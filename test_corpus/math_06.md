# Statistics and Data Analysis

**Topic:** Math
**Sub-Topic:** Statistics

This document covers statistics, the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. Statistics enables evidence-based decision-making and is fundamental to scientific research, business analytics, and machine learning.

### Descriptive Statistics
Measures of central tendency include mean, median, and mode. Measures of spread include variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range. These summarize data distributions and identify patterns.

### Inferential Statistics
Hypothesis testing evaluates claims about populations using sample data. Confidence intervals quantify estimation uncertainty. P-values measure evidence strength against null hypotheses.

### Probability Distributions
The normal distribution models many natural phenomena. The binomial distribution describes success counts in fixed trials. Understanding distributions is essential for proper statistical analysis.

### Correlation and Regression
Correlation measures linear relationships between variables. Regression models predict outcomes from predictors. These techniques reveal data relationships and enable predictions.

### Modern Applications
Statistics powers A/B testing in tech companies, clinical trial analysis in medicine, quality control in manufacturing, and predictive modeling in machine learning.

### Conclusion
Statistics provides rigorous methods for extracting insights from data, making it indispensable in our data-driven world across science, business, and technology.
