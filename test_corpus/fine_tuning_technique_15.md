# Fine-Tuning Technique 15

**Topic:** LLM
**Sub-Topic:** Fine-Tuning Techniques
**Sub-Sub-Topic:** Few-Shot Learning

This document discusses the fine-tuning technique known as Few-Shot Learning, which is a crucial aspect of optimizing large language models (LLMs). Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model to improve its performance on specific tasks or datasets. Few-Shot Learning enables adaptation with minimal labeled examples.

### Key Points
- **Definition:** Learns new tasks from a small number of examples.
- **Use Cases:** Rapid prototyping, low-resource languages.
- **Advantages:** Reduces annotation costs and time.
- **Challenges:** Performance may lag behind fully supervised approaches.
- **Best Practices:** Use prompt-based fine-tuning for best results.

### Example
A language model achieves 80% accuracy on a new dialect using only 50 labeled sentences.

### Conclusion
Few-Shot Learning is a powerful method for fine-tuning LLMs, enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. By understanding and applying this technique, practitioners can efficiently explore novel applications.
