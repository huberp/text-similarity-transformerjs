# Number Theory Basics

**Topic:** Math
**Sub-Topic:** Number Theory

This document introduces number theory, the study of integers and their properties. Often called the "purest" branch of mathematics, number theory has surprising applications in cryptography, computer science, and algorithm design.

### Fundamental Concepts
- **Prime Numbers:** Integers greater than 1 divisible only by 1 and themselves.
- **Divisibility:** Relationships between integers involving factors and multiples.
- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** Largest integer dividing two numbers.
- **Modular Arithmetic:** Arithmetic with remainders after division.
- **Congruences:** Equations involving modular arithmetic.

### Prime Number Theorem
This theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers, showing they become less frequent as numbers get larger. The density of primes near n is approximately 1/ln(n).

### Applications
Number theory powers modern cryptography through RSA and elliptic curve methods. Hash functions, pseudorandom number generators, and error-correcting codes also rely on number-theoretic principles.

### Classic Problems
The field includes famous unsolved problems like the Riemann Hypothesis and Goldbach's Conjecture, alongside celebrated results like Fermat's Last Theorem, proved in 1995.

### Conclusion
Number theory bridges pure mathematics and practical applications, demonstrating how abstract mathematical concepts can solve real-world problems in security and computation.
