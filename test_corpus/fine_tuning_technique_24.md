# Fine-Tuning Technique 24

**Topic:** LLM
**Sub-Topic:** Fine-Tuning Techniques
**Sub-Sub-Topic:** Ensemble Methods

This document discusses the fine-tuning technique known as Ensemble Methods, which is a crucial aspect of optimizing large language models (LLMs). Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model to improve its performance on specific tasks or datasets. Ensemble Methods combine multiple models for better performance.

### Key Points
- **Definition:** Aggregates predictions from several models.
- **Use Cases:** Maximizing accuracy, reducing variance.
- **Advantages:** Often outperforms individual models.
- **Challenges:** Increased computational and memory costs.
- **Best Practices:** Use diverse base models and weighted averaging.

### Example
An ensemble of five fine-tuned models achieves 95% accuracy, 3% higher than the best single model.

### Conclusion
Ensemble Methods are a powerful approach for fine-tuning LLMs, pushing the boundaries of performance. By understanding and applying this technique, practitioners can achieve state-of-the-art results.
