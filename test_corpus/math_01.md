# Linear Algebra Fundamentals

**Topic:** Math
**Sub-Topic:** Linear Algebra

This document explores fundamental concepts in linear algebra, a branch of mathematics essential for understanding modern machine learning, computer graphics, and scientific computing. Linear algebra studies vectors, vector spaces, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations.

### Core Concepts
- **Vectors:** Ordered lists of numbers representing points or directions in space.
- **Matrices:** Rectangular arrays of numbers used to represent linear transformations.
- **Vector Spaces:** Collections of vectors closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
- **Linear Independence:** Vectors that cannot be expressed as combinations of others.
- **Basis:** Minimal set of vectors spanning a vector space.

### Operations
Matrix multiplication combines transformations, while the transpose flips rows and columns. The determinant measures how transformations scale space. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal transformation invariants.

### Applications
Linear algebra underpins computer graphics transformations, neural network computations, quantum mechanics, and optimization algorithms. Understanding these concepts is crucial for technical fields.

### Systems of Equations
Solving linear systems involves finding values satisfying multiple equations simultaneously. Methods include Gaussian elimination, matrix inversion, and iterative techniques.

### Conclusion
Linear algebra provides a powerful framework for representing and solving problems involving multidimensional relationships, making it indispensable in science and engineering.
