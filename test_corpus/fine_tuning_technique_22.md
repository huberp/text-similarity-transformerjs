# Fine-Tuning Technique 22

**Topic:** LLM
**Sub-Topic:** Fine-Tuning Techniques
**Sub-Sub-Topic:** Data Augmentation

This document discusses the fine-tuning technique known as Data Augmentation, which is a crucial aspect of optimizing large language models (LLMs). Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model to improve its performance on specific tasks or datasets. Data Augmentation artificially expands the training dataset.

### Key Points
- **Definition:** Generates new training examples from existing data.
- **Use Cases:** Small datasets, improving robustness.
- **Advantages:** Reduces overfitting and improves generalization.
- **Challenges:** Augmentations must be realistic and task-appropriate.
- **Best Practices:** Use back-translation for NLP tasks.

### Example
A model fine-tuned on augmented data shows a 10% improvement in out-of-domain accuracy.

### Conclusion
Data Augmentation is a powerful method for fine-tuning LLMs, especially with limited data. By understanding and applying this technique, practitioners can build more robust and generalizable models.
