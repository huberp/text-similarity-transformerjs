# Calculus and Derivatives

**Topic:** Math
**Sub-Topic:** Calculus

This document introduces calculus, particularly differential calculus, which studies rates of change and slopes of curves. Calculus is fundamental to physics, engineering, economics, and optimization in machine learning.

### Fundamental Concepts
- **Limits:** The foundation of calculus, describing behavior as values approach a point.
- **Derivatives:** Measure instantaneous rate of change of a function.
- **Differentiation Rules:** Power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.
- **Critical Points:** Where derivatives equal zero or are undefined.
- **Optimization:** Using derivatives to find maximum and minimum values.

### Applications
Derivatives describe velocity and acceleration in physics, marginal cost in economics, and gradient descent in machine learning. The chain rule enables backpropagation in neural networks.

### Higher-Order Derivatives
Second derivatives measure curvature and acceleration. The second derivative test determines whether critical points are maxima, minima, or saddle points.

### Multivariable Calculus
Partial derivatives extend calculus to functions of multiple variables. Gradient vectors point in directions of steepest ascent, guiding optimization algorithms.

### Conclusion
Calculus provides essential tools for understanding change and optimization, making it indispensable for quantitative fields from physics to artificial intelligence.
