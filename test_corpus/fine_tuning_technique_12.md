# Fine-Tuning Technique 12

**Topic:** LLM
**Sub-Topic:** Fine-Tuning Techniques
**Sub-Sub-Topic:** Bias Mitigation

This document discusses the fine-tuning technique known as Bias Mitigation, which is a crucial aspect of optimizing large language models (LLMs). Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model to improve its performance on specific tasks or datasets. Bias Mitigation reduces unwanted biases in model outputs.

### Key Points
- **Definition:** Identifies and corrects biased behavior in models.
- **Use Cases:** Fairness-critical applications, compliance.
- **Advantages:** Promotes ethical AI and user trust.
- **Challenges:** Bias is often subtle and context-dependent.
- **Best Practices:** Use diverse datasets and bias evaluation metrics.

### Example
A hiring assistant model is fine-tuned to ignore gendered language in resumes, reducing demographic skew in recommendations.

### Conclusion
Bias Mitigation is a powerful method for fine-tuning LLMs, ensuring fair and inclusive outputs. By understanding and applying this technique, practitioners can build more responsible AI systems.
